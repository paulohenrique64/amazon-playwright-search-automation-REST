## About [REST Version]

I chose <strong> Playwright </strong> for this project due to its compatibility with multiple browsers, such as Chromium and Firefox, as well as its intuitive usability and excellent scalability.

In this <strong>version</strong>, when the user accesses the `/api/search/:keyword` endpoint, the express server returns a JSON containing the searched product data.
